This is my first (kind of) major project in web development field. 
It was a sort of assignment that helped me to brush my skills a lot. 
Although, it is not fully completed yet, some responsiveness is still missing in the site as well which i would fix in fututre. 
Also, the gallery page isn't loading the images from the assets section for some reason. 

If you know the reason, please let me know. Thanks for reading.
